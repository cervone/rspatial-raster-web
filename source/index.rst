Spatial Data Science with R
============================

This website provides materials to learn about spatial data analysis and modeling with *R*. *R* is a widely used programming language and software environment for data science. *R* has advanced capabilities for managing spatial data; and it provides unparalleled opportunities for analyzing such data.
